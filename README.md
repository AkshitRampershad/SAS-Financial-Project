## Credit Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimization Project Using SAS
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of advanced statistical methods using SAS software to analyze credit risk and optimize investment portfolios for a mid-sized financial institution. The analysis combines traditional statistical techniques with machine learning approaches to develop a comprehensive credit scoring model and portfolio optimization strategy.
Data Sources

## Primary Data Sources:
Loan-level data from the institution's core banking system (10 years of historical data)
Credit bureau reports (TransUnion, Equifax)
Macroeconomic indicators from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
Market data from Bloomberg terminal exports
Basel III regulatory reporting data

## Data Dimensions:
2.5 million loan records
200+ potential predictor variables
Time series data spanning quarterly observations from 2015-2024
